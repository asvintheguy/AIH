    {{ _.role("system") }}
    You are a medical assistant helping to identify key symptoms and generate relevant search queries for health datasets.
    
    {{ _.role("user") }}
    A patient has described these symptoms:
    "{{ symptoms }}"
    
    1. Extract the specific symptoms and potential conditions mentioned
    2. Generate 5-7 search queries to find relevant health datasets on Kaggle
    3. Make sure to include:
       - 5 specific queries focused on the exact symptoms
       - 5 more general queries for broader medical categories
       - 2 generic medical dataset queries (e.g., "patient health data CSV")
    4. Keep queries simple and use common medical terms
    5. Avoid overly specific combinations of symptoms in a single query
    
    For example, if someone mentions "chest pain and shortness of breath", good queries might be:
    - "chest pain dataset" (specific)
    - "shortness of breath data" (specific)
    - "heart condition dataset" (general category)
    - "respiratory health data" (general category)
    - "patient symptoms CSV" (generic)
    
    Return only the list of search queries that will find a good mix of specific and general relevant datasets.
    
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    
    First, analyze the symptoms systematically:
    - Identify key individual symptoms described by the patient
    - Map these symptoms to broader medical categories
    - Consider common medical terminology that would appear in dataset names
    - Create a mix of specific and general search terms
    - Keep search terms short and focused (2-4 words per query)
    - Use simple terms that match how datasets are typically named

    You are a model evaluation assistant for a health risk assessment system.

    Evaluate different machine learning models on this dataset:
    {{ dataset }}
    
    For each of these models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - XGBoost
    
    Provide realistic evaluation metrics:
    1. Model name
    2. Accuracy score (between 0.7 and 0.95)
    3. F1 score (between 0.65 and 0.92)
    4. The dataset title used
    
    Make sure the stronger models (like XGBoost and Gradient Boosting) generally
    outperform simpler models (like Logistic Regression) but not always.
    
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    
    First, consider the model evaluation process:
    - Analyze the dataset characteristics and how they might affect model performance
    - Consider the strengths and weaknesses of each model type for this kind of data
    - Think about realistic performance metrics for medical datasets
    - Determine which models would likely perform best on this specific dataset type

    {{ _.role("user") }}
    I have features from multiple health datasets that I need to consolidate for patient data collection.
    
    Here are the features from all datasets:
    {{ datasetFeatures }}
    
    Please:
    1. Identify similar features across datasets (e.g., "age" in one dataset is the same as "patient_age" in another)
    2. Create a user-friendly description for each feature (e.g., "blood_pressure" â†’ "Your blood pressure reading (systolic/diastolic, like 120/80)")
    3. Specify the data type for each feature (numeric or categorical)
    4. For categorical features, list possible values when clear from the feature name
    5. Track which datasets each consolidated feature belongs to
    
    Consolidate similar features together and create patient-friendly descriptions.
    
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    
    Before providing the final consolidated features, think through your approach:
    - Identify common medical features that appear across multiple datasets (possibly with different names)
    - Analyze naming patterns to detect equivalent features (e.g., "gender" vs "sex")
    - Consider medical domain knowledge to understand what each feature likely represents
    - Group features logically by the type of medical information they capture
    - Prioritize which features would be most important for comprehensive risk assessment

    Patient Data:
    {{ patientData }}
    
    Model Evaluations:

    Dataset:
    {{ dataset }}
    
    Select the best model from the evaluations (highest F1 score) and predict the risk 
    level for the health condition related to the dataset. The assessment should include:
    1. Disease name (derived from the dataset title)
    2. Risk level ("Low Risk", "Medium Risk", or "High Risk")
    3. Confidence level (between 0.5 and 0.95)
    4. Dataset used
    5. Model used
    
    Base your assessment on the patient's symptoms and data, especially symptoms that match
    the dataset's health condition focus.
    
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    
    First, outline your reasoning process step by step:

    - Determining which model performs best on this dataset and why
    - Explaining how you're determining the risk level and confidence

    A patient has described these symptoms:
    "{{ symptoms }}"
    
    I have found these potential datasets:
    {{ datasets }}
    
    Please analyze each dataset and select the most relevant ones that:
    1. Focus on patient symptoms similar to those described
    2. Include clinical features and patient data, not just statistics
    3. Would be most useful for health risk assessment of these specific symptoms
    4. Provide diverse coverage of the potential conditions suggested by these symptoms
    
    IMPORTANT: You MUST return at least 3 datasets, even if only 1-2 are highly relevant to the symptoms. 
    If more than 3 datasets are highly relevant, you may return up to 5.
    
    Return only the selected datasets, with updated relevance scores (0-1) indicating how well each matches the patient's symptoms.
    
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    
    First, carefully evaluate each dataset's relevance:
    - Analyze how closely each dataset title and description match the patient's symptoms
    - Consider which datasets likely contain actual patient symptom data vs. statistical data
    - Identify datasets that cover different aspects of the patient's symptoms
    - Assess which datasets would be most valuable for clinical risk assessment
    - Assign meaningful relevance scores based on symptom match and dataset quality
    - Remember that you must select at least 3 datasets, even if some are less relevant
