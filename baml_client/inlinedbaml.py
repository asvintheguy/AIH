Extract the specific symptoms and potential conditions mentioned\n    2. Generate 20 search queries to find relevant health datasets on Kaggle\n    3. Guidelines for effective queries:\n       - Use a mix of symptom-specific and condition-related terms\n       - Include some general medical category terms\n       - Keep queries simple (2-4 words is ideal)\n       - Use common medical terminology\n       - Vary the wording to maximize dataset discovery\n    4. Avoid overly specific combinations of symptoms in a single query\n    \n    For example, if someone mentions \"chest pain and shortness of breath\", good queries might include:\n    - \"chest pain dataset\"\n    - \"shortness of breath data\"\n    - \"heart condition dataset\"\n    - \"respiratory health data\"\n    - \"cardiovascular prediction\"\n    - \"breathing difficulty symptoms\"\n    - \"medical diagnosis data\"\n    \n    Return a diverse list of 20 search queries to maximize the chance of finding relevant datasets.\n    \n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n    \n    First, analyze the symptoms systematically:\n    - Identify key individual symptoms described by the patient\n    - Map these symptoms to possible medical conditions\n    - Consider common medical terminology that would appear in dataset names\n    - Create a diverse mix of search terms to maximize dataset discovery\n    - Keep search terms short and focused for better matches\n    - Generate variations of similar terms to increase coverage\n    ...\n    \n    {\n    ... // schema\n    }\n  \"#\n}\n\n// Tool to evaluate models on a dataset\nfunction EvaluateModels(dataset: DatasetInfo) -> ModelEvaluation[] {\n  client \"Flash25\"\n  prompt #\"\n    {{ _.role(\"system\") }}\n    You are a model evaluation assistant for a health risk assessment system.\n    \n    {{ _.role(\"user\") }}\n    Evaluate different machine learning models on this dataset:\n    {{ dataset }}\n    \n    For each of these models:\n    - Logistic Regression\n    - Random Forest\n    - Gradient Boosting\n    - XGBoost\n    \n    Provide realistic evaluation metrics:\n    1.
