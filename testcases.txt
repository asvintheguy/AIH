stroke - I have found my mom down this morning. She was unresponsive at first, but when she woke up the left side of her face was frozen. She couldn't even move the left side of her body. She was slurring her speech, seemed confused, and was dizzy.
celiac - Every time I eat pasta or bread, my stomach hurts a lot and it results in very watery stools. I don't have this problem with any other kinds of foods.
heart attack - I have chest pain with pain rating down my left arm and into my hands. I have shortness of breath and it feels like I am about to pass out.
Alzheimers - I have been worrying about my dad. Lately, he's been experiencing memory loss. For example, he forgets who I am and who his grandchildren are. He also tends to wander and loses track of dates like appointments and birthdays. He hasn't forgetten these in the past. He's also been acting different usually he is pretty calm and collected but recently he's been more agressive, combative, and moody. He also does everyday tasks strangely, like he almost forgot how to brush his teeth or bathe.
